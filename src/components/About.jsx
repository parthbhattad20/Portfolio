                    As a student of Electronics and Telecommunication, I have
                    delved deep into the intricate workings of electronic
                    systems and communication networks. Through my academic
                    journey, I have gained a solid understanding of concepts
                    related to signal processing, circuit design, and
                    communication protocols, empowering me to analyze and solve
                    complex engineering problems effectively.

                    <h1 className="font-bold">MERN Stack and Beyond:</h1>
                    Alongside my engineering pursuits, I have honed my skills as
                    a Full Stack Developer, specializing in the MERN (MongoDB,
                    Express, React, Node.js) stack. My proficiency in this
                    technology stack allows me to create robust, scalable, and
                    dynamic web applications. Moreover, I have also ventured
                    into Next.js, a powerful framework for building server-side
                    rendered React applications, elevating my ability to deliver
                    seamless user experiences.
